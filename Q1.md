1. With the aid of examples explain the rules of Big O notation in algorithm analysis (5
marks)

1)**Focus on the dominant term**: Only focus on the dominant term that matters since it has a big impact when the size of the input increases 

ie  O(n² + n)-> O(n²)

2)**Ignore constants**: Lower order terms and also coefficients are irrelevant for larger inputs so they end up  being ignored in the Notation

i.e:O(2n)->O(n)

3)**Input size changes should be considered** 

i.e: when the algorithm starts having its input size reducing consider logarithmic growth i.e binary searches where each steps halves the input thus efficient

4)**Space Complexity rule**
Always account for extra memory usage 

i.e Such as recursion stacks store function calls in the memory

5)**Drop non-dominant terms** 
Retain the highest term for complexities that are combined 

i.e O(n+n2+logn)->O(n2) n²is the fastest growing  log n and i have been dropped
