1. With the aid of examples explain the rules of Big O notation in algorithm analysis (5
marks)

1)**Focus on the dominant term**: Only focus on the dominant term that matters 

ie  O(n² + n)-> O(n²)

2)**Ignore constants**: Lower order terms and also coefficients are irrelevant for larger inputs

i.e:O(2n)->O(n)

3)**Input size changes should be considered** 

i.e:when input size reduces consider logarithmic growth i.e binary searches

4)**Space Complexity rule**
Always account for extra memory usage 

i.e Such as recursion stacks

5)**Drop non-dominant terms** 
Retain the highest term for complexities that are combined 

i.e O(n+n2+logn)->O(n2)
