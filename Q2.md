Differentiate between arrays and linked lists in terms of:
 Memory allocation
 Performance
 Insertion and deletion operations
(6 marks) 


1)**Arrays allocate contiguous block of memory while linked lists allocate memory dynamically for each needed element**


2)**Arrays have faster access to elements due to indexing allowing for direct access linked lists have slower access to elements since transversal is needed to find the element**


3)**Arrays involve shifting subsequent elements while linked lists occur as per a reference to the position to where the change should occur**
